# Collaborative Filtering Mining Methods in Item Recommandation from Implicit Feedback
This is the implementation of some collaborative filtering methods learning from implicit feedback.


## Methods
These methods include:
- KNN & Adaptive KNN implementation (traditional Python implementation)
- BPR model (Pytorch implementation)
- Implicit MF model (Pytorch implementation)
- BPR-Softmax model (Pytorch implementation)


## Datasets
Datasets used are MovieLens-100K & MovieLens-1M (source: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).


## Run
To run the code, make sure you have installed Torch in conda environment. Then feel free to open each Jupyter notebook and run, all procedures including data preprocess, training, evaluation are self-contained in each notebook.
