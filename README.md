### Collaborative Filtering Mining Methods in Item Recommandation from Implicit Feedback
This is the implementation of some collaborative filtering methods learning from implicit feedback.


These methods include:
- KNN & Adaptive KNN implementation (traditional Python implementation)
- BPR model (Pytorch implementation)
- Implicit MF model (Pytorch implementation)
- BPR-Softmax model (Pytorch implementation)


Datasets used are MovieLens-100K & MovieLens-1M (source: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).


To run the code, feel free to open each Jupyter notebook and run, all procedures including data preprocess, training, evaluation are self-contained in each notebook.
